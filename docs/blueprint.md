# **App Name**: Mimir Zenith

## Core Features:

- Scroll-Driven Visual Narrative: Implement a full-screen, scroll-controlled WebP image sequence for the hero section, with frames playing forward on scroll down and in reverse on scroll up, optimized for smooth performance using requestAnimationFrame.
- Dynamic Product Variant Display: Present product-specific details including name, subtitle, and description within the hero text block, dynamically updating these elements based on the active product variant and its configured theme color.
- Intuitive Variant Selector: Develop the right-side vertical navigation strip with PREV/NEXT controls, enabling users to seamlessly switch between product variants, including a small loading indicator and smooth transitions for content updates.
- Elegant Preloading Experience: Integrate a full-screen preloader featuring the Mimir logo, a progress bar, and percentage display, ensuring the initial hero image sequence loads completely before revealing the website content. Also, include a subtle indicator for variant switching.
- Persistent Navigation & Footer: Create a sticky top navigation bar with smooth-scrolling links and active section highlighting, alongside a minimal footer for essential information, both designed in a dark, clean aesthetic.
- Informational Content Sections: Implement below-hero content sections such as 'About Product', 'Benefits', 'Ingredients', 'How to Use', 'Reviews', 'FAQ', and a final Call to Action, each adhering to the minimal, typography-driven design language.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary brand color (Mimir Violet): A rich, deep violet (#6A2EB8) for hero accents and interactive elements, inspired by the profound calm of deep sleep.
- Background color (Night Bloom Dark): A heavily desaturated, almost black violet (#1E1A23), providing a sophisticated and immersive dark mode canvas, evocative of twilight hours.
- Accent color (Celestial Blue): A vibrant, analogous blue-violet (#8468FF) chosen for key interactive elements like CTA buttons and active navigation states, signifying clarity and gentle guidance.
- Unified typography using 'Inter' (sans-serif) across all elements. Its clean, modern lines and excellent legibility are perfect for conveying a premium, tech-inspired minimalist aesthetic for both headlines and body text, allowing for strong typographic hierarchy.
- Minimal, sharp, and highly refined line icons will be used where necessary (e.g., for 'Benefits' section), maintaining visual simplicity and luxury, either in white or with a subtle application of the accent color.
- The design will feature generous use of negative space, full-screen cinematic hero sections, and highly structured, clean content blocks, emphasizing Apple-level precision and a sophisticated, uncluttered visual flow.
- Animations are meticulously crafted to be smooth, performant, and purposeful—primarily scroll-controlled hero sequence, subtle fades for variant transitions, and smooth-scroll navigation—avoiding excess to maintain a premium and cinematic user experience.
